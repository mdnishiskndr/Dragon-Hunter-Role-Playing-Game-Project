Overview:

This project is a browser-based RPG game titled "Dragon Hunter" where players engage in a series of adventures to prepare for and ultimately fight a dragon. The game's interface displays the player's stats (XP, Health, and Gold) and provides control buttons to navigate through different locations and actions. Players can visit the store to buy health or weapons, venture into a cave to fight monsters, or directly engage in a dragon fight. The game's logic manages player actions, inventory, monster encounters, and game state transitions. Players earn gold and XP by defeating monsters, which they can use to purchase upgrades. Random events, such as weapon breakage during fights, add unpredictability. The ultimate goal is to defeat the dragon, with win and lose conditions providing a clear end to the game. The project combines dynamic updates, user interactions, and a simple yet engaging storyline to create an interactive gaming experience.
